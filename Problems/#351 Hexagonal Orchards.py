n = 1000000

#the hexagonal is symettrical in 1/6 ratio, so if i find the result in one of 
#the triangles i can multiply it by 6.
#we notice that once you index the dots. as n = the layer number, i = the index
#at that layer; (1,1) / (1,2)  (2,2) .... If gcd(i,n) = 1 we will call that dot a prime dot 
#notice that once a dot can be factorised (ie. (4,6)) it will be blocked by its primeDot -> (2,3)  
#therefore within a layer we look for the number of dots(i,n), where gcd(i,n) =1
#if we subtract the number of blocked dots from the n, we get the visible dots.

#Now, we know that within a layer n, all the dots will have the same n. and 0< i < n+1
#Thre fore we actually look for the amount of coprimes of n that are positive and smaller
#than n. Which is phi(n).

# now all we need (6 * [n*(n+1)/2 - Sigma(n=0 to 1000000)phi(n)]) 

#I used GTP 4-0 to document the function below....

def compute_totients(N):
    """
    Compute the Euler's Totient (œÜ) values for all integers from 1 to N using a modified Sieve of Eratosthenes.
    
    Euler's Totient function œÜ(n) is the number of integers from 1 to n that are coprime with n.
    This function uses an efficient sieve-based approach to calculate the Totient values for all numbers 
    from 1 to N in O(N log log N) time complexity.

    Parameters:
    N (int): The upper bound up to which Totient values are calculated (inclusive).

    Returns:
    phi (list): A list where phi[i] gives the Totient value for the integer i (i.e., œÜ(i)).
