Whole reason of this project is to strengthen my math foundations. Especially combinatorics and Number Theory. 
Each p file is a question that is solved, and it includes the answer as a comment, so be cautius for spoilers!!!. 
The file names are the question names which also include their id's.
As of now i dont plan to use any external libraries.
I will prefer creating some brilliant built in functions from scratch to understand them better.
Feel free to pl if you have a faster/(slower but smarter)  solution. 

Current progress = 10 / 911
